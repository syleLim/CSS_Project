## margin and float

Each float blocks are never overlay, we use this with width

## display : flex

If you want to align height of objects in div, use `display : flex`.<br>Flex is efficient when elements size are **ambiguous.**<br>If it isnt worked, use `inline-flex`. Inline-flex is for vertical align wrap div, but sometimes used when flex is not worked.
